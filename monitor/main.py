"""Entrypoint.

Usage:
  python -m monitor.main --tier bigtech            # big names only (odd hours)
  python -m monitor.main --tier all                # full sweep (even hours)
  python -m monitor.main --tier all --dry-run      # print, don't save/notify
  python -m monitor.main --include-staff           # also admit Staff titles

--profile picks which tracker to run (see monitor/profiles.py): its company
registry, its role rules, its state file and its Discord webhook. There is one
today (india-java), and it is the default.

First run behavior: if the state file is empty, all found jobs are SEEDED
into state without Discord notifications (avoids a 500-message flood).
