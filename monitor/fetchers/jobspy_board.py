"""Aggregator fetcher: JobSpy (LinkedIn, Naukri, Indeed, Glassdoor, Google...).

Every other fetcher in this package talks to one company's ATS. This one talks
to the job boards themselves, via https://github.com/speedyapply/JobSpy, which
is how LinkedIn becomes reachable at all: LinkedIn has no public jobs API, and
its own careers listings are not served by any ATS this repo can query. JobSpy
drives the boards' internal search endpoints and hands back one table.

What that buys, and what it costs:

  + Coverage no company registry can match. A LinkedIn search sweeps every
    employer at once, including the ones with no queryable board (Meta, most
    of finance, anyone on a bespoke careers page).
  - The boards rank by relevance, not completeness, so a search is a sample
    rather than a listing. `searches:` (handled in main.run_fetcher) is how
    the sample is widened: one term per job family, merged.
  - The same posting also reaches us through the company's own ATS, under a
    different id and URL. Rows here are marked `soft_dedupe`, which tells
    state.add_new to fold them into the ATS copy instead of tracking the job
    twice (see state.soft_key).
  - LinkedIn rate-limits hard, and blocks datacenter IPs more readily than
    residential ones. `proxies_env` names an environment variable holding a
    comma-separated proxy list, so a blocked runner is a secret away from
    working rather than a code change.

Config (config/companies*.yaml):

    - name: LinkedIn (JobSpy)
      fetcher: jobspy
      sites: [linkedin]          # any of linkedin|naukri|indeed|glassdoor|google
      location: India
      country: India             # Indeed's country; also tags every row as India
      results_wanted: 100        # per search term, per site
      hours_old: 48              # only postings newer than this
      fetch_description: false   # +1 request per job; see below
      proxies_env: JOBSPY_PROXIES
      searches:
        - senior java developer
        - java backend developer

`fetch_description: true` pulls each posting's body, which is what
filters.parse_yoe reads to correct a tier the title got wrong. It costs one
extra request per job (~1.2s each on LinkedIn) and multiplies the rate-limit
exposure, so it is off by default and worth turning on only for the narrow,
high-value searches.
