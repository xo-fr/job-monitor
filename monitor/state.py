"""State persistence: each tracker's JSON file is its single source of truth.

Which file that is comes from the running profile (monitor/profiles.py) -
docs/data/jobs.json by default. This layer never inspects the tier vocabulary
or the role buckets, so it works unchanged for any profile.

      # only ever reads past it, so the activity history is never rewritten
      "applied_on": "YYYY-MM-DD"

}

The dashboard edits only the "status" field; the scanner only adds new ids
and never overwrites an existing entry, so user edits are always preserved.
Enrichment fields are the one exception: they are backfilled onto existing
entries when previously missing, which never touches "status".
