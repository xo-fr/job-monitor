"""Drop tracked postings that are not in India after all.

jobs.json accumulates; a filter fix only changes what future scans admit, so
postings that a since-fixed hole let in stay on the dashboard forever. This
re-applies the *current* location rules to what is already stored.

Entries the dashboard owns are never touched: anything whose status has moved
off "new" is reported and kept, because a posting you have already applied to
is worth more than a tidy feed.

Usage:  python -m monitor.prune [--dry-run]
